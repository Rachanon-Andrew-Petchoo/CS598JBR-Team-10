The problem is asking for a function that calculates the number of collisions between two sets of cars. The cars are moving in opposite directions, so they will never collide. Therefore, the function can simply return 0.

This function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars in each direction. It returns 0, as there are no collisions between the two sets of cars.
